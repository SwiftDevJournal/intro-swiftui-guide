# Where to Go from Here?

If you read through this entire guide, you're ready to move on to the various SwiftUI learning resources available online. This page lists places you can go to learn SwiftUI development.

## Courses

* [Apple's Develop Apps for iOS course](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/)
* [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
* [Stanford's CS193P course](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu)

The Stanford course is the same course computer science students at Stanford take to learn iOS development so it moves at a faster pace than the other courses.

## Articles and Tutorials

My site, [Swift Dev Journal](https://www.swiftdevjournal.com), has SwiftUI articles and tutorials.

The [iOS Dev Directory](https://iosdevdirectory.com) is a massive collection of iOS development blogs, some of which cover SwiftUI. Import the OPML files into an RSS reader like [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) to find articles to read.
