# Swift Dev Journal Intro to SwiftUI

SwiftUI is Apple's new framework for making user interfaces and apps for Apple's platforms: iOS, Mac, tvOS, and watchOS. There are many resources available for learning SwiftUI, including [Hacking with Swift's](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) [100 day course on SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). But if you are new to developing apps for Apple's platforms, you may find that the courses and other learning materials move too fast. This guide introduces SwiftUI at a slower pace.
