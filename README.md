# Swift Dev Journal Intro to SwiftUI

SwiftUI is Apple's new framework for making user interfaces and apps for Apple's platforms: iOS, Mac, tvOS, and watchOS. There are many resources available for learning SwiftUI, including [Hacking with Swift's100 day course on SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). But if you are new to developing apps for Apple's platforms, you may find that the courses and other learning materials move too fast. This guide introduces SwiftUI at a slower pace.

## Have a Question?

I want this guide to be useful to people new to developing for Apple's forums. I put the guide on GitHub so I can easily update it. If you have a question or find I didn't explain something clearly in this guide, go to my [contact page](https://www.swiftdevjournal.com/contact/) and send an email so I can improve this guide.
