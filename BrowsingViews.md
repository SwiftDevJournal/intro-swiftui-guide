# Browsing the SwiftUI View Library

Hold down the Option key and click the Add button to open the SwiftUI view library. Option-clicking the Add button will keep the library window open until you close it.

If the library window shows code snippets instead of SwiftUI views, make sure you have a SwiftUI view file open and have the preview canvas open. The preview canvas must be open for the library window to show SwiftUI views.

## View Library Contents

The left side of the library window shows the available SwiftUI views, starting with controls, followed by layout views, and ending with miscellaneous.

Selecting a view fills the right side of the window with a summary of the view.

## Adding a Control to Your View

Selecting a control from the view library and dragging it to the view's Swift file adds the control to your SwiftUI view.
